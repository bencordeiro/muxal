//! Cross-crate "something needs a Windows present" flag.
//!
//! gpui-on-Windows draws from key handlers without presenting; the app's present
//! pump forces `WM_PAINT`. Terminal notify/key paths arm this flag so the pump
//! can skip work when nothing happened (see `muxal::present_pump`).
//!
//! **Temporary with the pump:** remove this module when zed#61469 is fixed in
//! our gpui pin and the present pump is deleted (see `present_pump.rs` header).
