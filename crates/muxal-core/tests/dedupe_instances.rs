//! `dedupe_instances` — the load-time repair for a workspace that ended up with two
//! panes on one tmux session.
//!
//! Two instances bound to the same session both attach to it as tmux clients: they
//! mirror each other keystroke for keystroke while muxal treats them as separate
//! agents, and closing either kills the session under the other. It happened for
//! real — two concurrent remote connects each adopted the host's running sessions —
//! and a workspace that got into the state must not reproduce it every launch.
