//! Auto-continue: nudge a stalled agent to keep going when its plan isn't done.

//! Agents that lay out a multi-phase plan sometimes finish the first phase and
//! stop, waiting, even though the todo list still has unchecked items. This is the
//! pure, I/O-free brain behind the pane's **Auto** toggle: given what an agent
//! pane is doing and what's on its screen, it decides whether to type `continue`.
//!
//! Everything here is deterministic and unit-tested. The app (`muxal` crate)
//! samples each auto-enabled pane every tick, feeds its status and visible screen
//! to [`AutoContinue::step`], and acts on the returned [`AutoAction`]. No timers,
//! no I/O, no agent-specific coupling beyond the todo-list heuristics below.
