//! A GUI app is not launched from a shell, so it has no locale unless the OS
//! session provides one — and on macOS none does: `launchctl getenv LANG` is
//! empty, so an app opened from Finder (or from a `.app` bundle) hands every
//! child it spawns an environment with no `LANG`, `LC_ALL` or `LC_CTYPE` at all.
//!
//! Programs that decide how to encode their output from the locale then fall back
//! to ASCII. tmux is the loud one: with no UTF-8 locale its client replaces every
//! non-ASCII cell with `_` on its way to the terminal, so box-drawing and glyphs
//! come out as garbage no redraw can fix.

/// The locale to fall back to. macOS ships no `C.UTF-8`, but `en_US.UTF-8` is
/// always present; elsewhere `C.UTF-8` is the locale-independent choice.
