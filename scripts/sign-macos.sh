# Two modes, chosen by whether MACOS_CERTIFICATE is set:
#
#   * Developer ID (proper distribution): imports the cert, codesigns with the
#     hardened runtime, then — if a notary key is also set — notarizes via Apple
#     and staples the ticket. The result opens with no Gatekeeper warning.
#
#   * No cert (default): ad-hoc signs (`codesign -s -`). The app launches (Apple
#     Silicon requires at least an ad-hoc signature), but downloaded copies still
#     hit Gatekeeper's "unidentified developer" prompt.
#
# macOS signing REQUIRES a paid Apple Developer Program membership ($99/yr) — there
# is no managed/free alternative like Windows' Azure Trusted Signing. To enable
# the Developer ID path, set these GitHub Actions secrets:
#
#   MACOS_CERTIFICATE       base64 of a "Developer ID Application" .p12
#                           (Apple Developer portal → Certificates → Developer ID
#                            Application; export from Keychain as .p12, then
#                            `base64 -i cert.p12 | pbcopy`)
#   MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PWD   the .p12 export password
#   MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY     e.g. "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
#   MACOS_NOTARY_KEY        base64 of an App Store Connect API key (.p8)
#                           (App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations →
#                            Keys; role "Developer"; download the .p8 once)
#   MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID     the key's ID
#   MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID  the issuer ID shown on that Keys page
